# The Lots of Money License 💰

### Introduction

Since I've begun using a computer, I've been "agreeing" to the kilometric blurbs software is bundled with way too often, without really understanding what they mean (or even trying in case of EULAs). 
Even the simplest and clearest license, which for me is the [MIT], took me a while to fully understand it. 
It's true that English is not my mother tongue, but why should such complicated terminology be used? Can't we express the same, common meaning with more ease?

I find this frustrating.

One day I came across the [espresso](https://github.com/jack23247/espresso-license) and [energy-drink](https://github.com/dlcgold/energy_drink-license) licenses.
While I was impressed with the idea, I was a little disappointed with the specificity of the items.
Don't get me wrong, I like Coffee and Energy Drinks but how nice is it to choose what to have.

Thus, the [Lots-of-Money License](LICENSE) was born.

### It's a fork!

This license is a fork of these others...
- [beer-ware-license](https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/)
- [sushi-ware-license](https://github.com/MakeNowJust/sushi-ware)
- [espresso-license](https://github.com/jack23247/espresso-license)
- [energy-drink-license](https://github.com/dlcgold/energy_drink-license)
- [spaghetti-license](https://github.com/Steepo/spaghetti-license)
- [pizza-license](https://github.com/PumaConcolor/pizza-license)


### It's also a joke!
This license is definitely a joke, but if someone doesn't notice it wouldn't be a problem.
